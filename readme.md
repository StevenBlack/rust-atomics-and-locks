At the moment this is just a bunch of disenbodied code snippets that live 
in the `examples/` folder, which is implicitly supported by Cargo.

Full credit to
[Add examples to your Rust libraries](http://xion.io/post/code/rust-examples.html)
by [Karol Kuczmarski](https://github.com/Xion), and  to the
[Rust Cargo Team](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo) for the structure of this
repository.

## Sample calls

```bash
$ cargo run --example ex_01_01
```

```bash
$ cargo run --example ex_01_02
```

etc...
