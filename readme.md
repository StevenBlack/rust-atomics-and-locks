# Rust Atomics and Locks

Working through [Rust Atomics and Locks](https://marabos.nl/atomics/) by Mara Bos.

At the moment this is just a bunch of disenbodied code snippets that live in the
`exaples/` folder.

## Sample calls

```bash
$ cargo run --example ex_01_01
```

```bash
$ cargo run --example ex_01_02
```

etc...
