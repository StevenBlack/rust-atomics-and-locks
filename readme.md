# Rust Atomics and Locks

Working through (Rust Atomics and Locks)[https://marabos.nl/atomics/] by Mara Bos.

At the moment this is just a bunch of disenbodied code snippets. I'll try to make it more coherent as I go.

## Sample calls

```bash
$ cargo run --example ex_01_01
```

```bash
$ cargo run --example ex_01_02
```

etc...
